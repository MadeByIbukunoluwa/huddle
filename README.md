* This was a simple 2 day long side project built during my free time to enable me develop a better understanding of Styled Components as a CSS in JS styling framework included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with the styled componenet documentation for new features and develop a better understanding of how it works.

* I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate, then added styeld-components 

* I chose styled compoenents because it provided me with a more flexible opportunity to use props to change styling in the styled component as opposed to traditional css styling with classes where you have to add inline javascript and do conditionally render classes, it also helped me eliminate class name bugs by dynamically generating them for me
